# Egg Timer

A simple iOS app built with SwiftUI that helps you cook the perfect eggâ€”soft, medium, or hard. Just tap on the egg type, and the timer will count down to zero while displaying a friendly interface. When time is up, a built-in system sound will play to alert you.

(All PNG images and the app icon were drawn by me using Procreate.)
